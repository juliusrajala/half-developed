The title speaks for itself. Half-developed is software engineering blog exploring some of my hobby-projects in various web technologies and the accumulated learnings and thoughts.

## Half-developed

This blog is a collection of ramblings and tips regarding a variety of software-engineering topics. As one of my goals for 2021, I decided to try to write more to improve me in this profession.

As a verbal person, the pandemic has not been kind. I'm hoping I'll find some small victories from these writing prompts.

The site itself is open source and you're free to submit suggested edits to it in its [Github-repository](https://github.com/juliusrajala/half-developed).

## Me

I'm Julius Rajala, a Finnish software engineer living somewhere in the southern parts of Finland. I build software for a living and as a hobby.

Employment-wise, I'm a partner at [Identio](https://www.identio.fi), working on their new Helsinki functions and a co-founder of [Blalab](https://www.blalabinsights.com).

I enjoy hand-craft websites, beers and bicycles. I've also been dreaming about getting my own sailing boat one of these days.
