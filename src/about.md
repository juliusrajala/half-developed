## Me

I'm a Finnish software engineer living somewhere in the southern parts of Finland. I build software for a living and as a hobby.

Employment-wise, I'm a partner at [Identio](https://www.identio.fi), working on their new Helsinki functions and a co-founder of [Blalab](https://www.blalabinsights.com).

I enjoy hand-craft websites, beers and bicycles. I've also been dreaming about getting my own sailing boat one of these days.
